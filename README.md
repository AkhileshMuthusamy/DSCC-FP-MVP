# DSCC-FP-MVP

Stock market prediction has been advanced since the beginning of Machine Learning that has started a new era in the field of technology. There are many approaches to predict stock market data based on the size of data and its features. 

In this project we are going to use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) methos which is a deep learning recurrent neural network. LSTM has feedback connections and can perform for full length data sequences. LSTM is basically imported from Keras library and it has the ability to forecast the nearest values of the stocks. The price prediction depends upon the number of layers which are set during the build of a model. 

As per the best practices to develop a machine learning model we have few mandatory steps to be followed. 

* Data Collection 
* Data Preparation 
* Choosing a Model 
* Train the Model 
* Evaluate the Model 
* Parameter Tuning 
* Predictions 

## Technology Stack:
 
The MVP project has four main components: frontend, backend, ML model and database.

* Frontend - Web App: Angular / React.js
* Backend - Python: Flask
* ML Model - Python: Jupyter notebook
* Database - MongoDB / Firebase

# Environment

* Development - `dev` branch
* Testing - `uat` branch
* Production - `main` branch
